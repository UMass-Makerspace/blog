## The Surprisingly Simple Process of 3D Modeling with Photogrammetry

Have you ever seen something or someone and thought, “Hey… I’d like to turn this into a 3D model that I can print”. Well think no more, I’m going to tell you how to get started, all you need is a smartphone and a computer. 

I got started using a drone, where images from above can provide quick and highly accurate models of large areas and buildings. But, the concepts are scalable, and a phone camera works just fine for small objects and people.

Anyway, I used Agisoft Metashape to get started. It is a great product with a 30-day free trial and a very quick, easy download which is compatible
with Linux, Mac, and Windows. Give it a Google
search and find the free trial install.
