<p>Welcome to the staff of the UMass Amherst Makerspace</p>
<p>The UMass Amherst Makerspace is an interdisciplinary makerspace open to students, staff, and faculty from all majors and disciplines.</p>
<p>We provide access to space, tools, equipment, training, and help connect individuals and facilitate mentorship and sharing of knowledge.</p>
<p>A major focus of the makerspace is re-use, repair, and re-purposing. We want to reduce waste and costs by serving as a hub for the community to share used tools, equipment, materials, furniture, and more. Much of what we have has been donated or saved from the campus waste stream.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The UMass Amherst Maker Network is an ongoing project to connect students, faculty, and staff with resources for making all over campus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To connect the UMass Amherst maker community with information and access pathways to existing resources on campus, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>facilities and equipment</li>
<li>people and expertise</li>
<li>workshops, and events</li>
</ul>
<p>To create a central All-Campus Makerspace, which will:</p>
<ul>
<li>serve as a starting point for most makers on campus</li>
<li>provide access to training and equipment for many common maker technologies</li>
<li>serve as the campus maker community focal point and host events related to making</li>
</ul>
<p>Our temporary location for Spring 2020 is the Astronomy Building, located near ELab and the Gunness Laboratory at the location indicated on the map above.</p>
<p>If you would like to visit the makerspace in this location and are looking to plan your visit with accessibility in mind, send an email to <a href="umamakerspace@umass.edu">umamakerspace@umass.edu</a></p>
