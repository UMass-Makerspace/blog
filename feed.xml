If nothing else, most of us will know this car from its iconic role as the time machine from the Back to the Future movies. As far as critical vehicles in cinema goes, the DeLorean rides with the best of them, alongside Star Wars’s Millenium Falcon and The Interceptor from Mad Max.  It is a car that we assign as much personality to as we do the paid actors it appears alongside. But while many will recognize it from the B2TF trilogy, far less are familiar with the car in real life,the man who created it , and the bizarre drama behind it. The story of John Z. DeLorean and his iconic car is one of celebrities, corporate sabotage, a war-torn Northern Ireland, the war on drugs, supermodels, cocaine smugglers, the FBI, and finally, the utter and complete failure of one of the most famous vehicles in automotive history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/delorean/img1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Delorean&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;John Z. DeLorean&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter the main character of our story: John Z. DeLorean. Human DeLorean is, obviously, responsible for car DeLorean. But aside from that he can almost be considered single-handedly responsible for some of the biggest landmarks of automotive history. Particularly, the creation of the “muscle car” genre. Muscle cars are kind of vaguely defined as mid-sized cars with big honkin’ engines. Iconic flagship muscle cars include the Ford Mustang, Dodge Challenger, you know, loud, fast, vroom vroom machines that your mom wrinkles her nose at. But the one that started it all was the Pontiac GTO in 1964, and this was DeLoreans first major contribution to the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-GTO, the Pontiac branch of GM was on its decline, seen by the masses as an amorphous, boring, “granny” brand that didn’t quite fit in the line-up. It was surprising that DeLorean would pick to work at Pontiac when approached by GM with a job offer at his choice of any of the company’s 5 divisions. At the time, nobody had even considered cramming big engines into midsize cars, and GM even went as far as forbidding it (Granny wants a car that goes from 0-60 in 7.7 years, not 7.7 seconds). But DeLorean, determined to make a name for himself and break into the hip youngster market, would characteristically jump through loopholes to bring this car to reality by making it an option to the pre-established Pontiac Tempest. Imagine taking a bigass truck engine and stuffing it under the hood of your mom’s camry. This is, in essence, what DeLorean did to the Tempest. The GTO ended up selling 9 times the initial production in the first year (that’s business-talk for doing really freaking well), saving the failing Pontiac brand and transforming it from the granny brand into GM’s designated performance division. The success of the GTO brought DeLorean into the public eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/delorean/img2.png&quot; alt=&quot;GTO 1964&quot; /&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Two advertisements for the Pontiac GTO from 1964  (Top) and 1968 (Bottom)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following years, DeLorean just kept climbing the ladder. His braggadocious attitude and loud charisma turned him into a celebrity and his numerous patents and innovations turned him into an industry icon. He would go on to head the design of the Pontiac Firebird in ‘67, the Grand Prix in ‘69, and he became the youngest division head in GM history at the age of 40. All of this was just fine and dandy, except that, in addition to being GM’s golden boy, everyone in the company HATED his ass. See, DeLorean wasn’t your typical 3-piece-suit businessman. He was a pop culture icon who thrived on attention, risk-taking, and surfing on a wave of fat paychecks and blown-out ego. Instead of a suit and tie, DeLorean wore turtlenecks. He had cool-guy sideburns and married young supermodels. He went on interviews openly bragging about his sex drive (gross, I know). He led ad campaigns that featured tigers and would openly challenge the competition by touting the abilities of his vehicles to beat anything that anybody else had to offer (even if they couldn’t). DeLoreans behavior and “fuck you, pay me” attitude rubbed all the GM executives wrong, but the numbers he was able to produce made him untouchable. That is until they didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;(Top) Delorean, posing with the Pontiac Firebird, (Bottom) Dude really liked his tigers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you broke out the ol’ Ouija board and asked him yourself, John DeLorean would probably say that he quit his job at GM because he was sick of the politics and the corporate song and dance. Some other sources will say that he was fired for publicly shit-talking his co-workers and superiors. Either way, DeLorean left GM (and his multi-million dollar salary) in 1973. That same year, (after some plastic surgery, weight-lifting, and a new supermodel wife,) he founded DeLorean Motor Company (DMC) to build his dream car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/delorean/img6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Delorean weightlifting&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;I wasn’t joking about the weight lifting, this was a photo of him from an early ‘70s magazine. Compare the Firebird pic above and you can see his new chin, too&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Christine Ferrare, world famous supermodel and DeLorean’s third wife&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of starting a brand new, mass production car brand in 1973 was lunacy. That last time a new, fully independent car brand had shown up on the market had been Chrysler in the 1920s, and even they went bankrupt along the way. But DeLorean was determined to be the David to GM’s Goliath. He had long-since had plans tucked away to build his dream car, a “sports racing car that’s designed to have an eternal life.” This car, as you may have guessed, would eventually evolve into the DMC DeLorean. After stealing Pontiac’s chief engineer, Bill Collins, they got straight to work, and in 1976, the first prototype of the DMC-12 rolled out for debut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/delorean/img8.png&quot; alt=&quot;DMC-12&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Delorean and Ferrare posing with the DMC-12 design car.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DMC-12 was the original title of the car now known simply as the DeLorean. The number referring to its original goal of having a retail price of $12,000 ($54,000 in 2019). It featured a stainless steel body (since paint is for losers). It had angles, it was low, it had gull-wing doors because horizontal doors are for peasants. The prototype was received with such high praise that critics were claiming it to be “as significant as the Ford Model A.” This was supposed to be the affordable sports car for the people, and waiting lists formed almost immediately, with many willing to pay up to $10,000 over retail in order to get their hands on one. The hype was unbelievably dramatic for this car, and how could it not, with John Zachary DeLorean’s name on it? As part of a promotional deal with American Express, they even advertised a special edition DeLorean, plated with 24 karat gold which could be bought for $85,000 ($240,000 in 2019). Creating a gold-plated car with your own name on it is by far one of the biggest flexes I can think of, and completely in-character for the kind of guy DeLorean was. He opened his product to investors, pulled in legendary design engineers Collin Chapman and Giorgetto Giugiaro, and began looking for a location to build his production plant, taking us to the unlikely location of Northern Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the incentive of £100 million from the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association, DeLorean decided to set up shop in Dunberry, Northern Ireland. At this time, Northern Ireland was effectively a warzone filled with shootings, bombings, and mass unemployment - it was violence in the streets. People were dying and families were starving here, but none of this would deter Mr. DeLorean McBadass. Under a 2 year timeframe, with a completely inexperienced workforce, rapidly approaching release date, and only a prototype to work off of, the DeLorean factory began production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/delorean/img9.png&quot; alt=&quot;Northern Ireland Troubles&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A scene from Northern Ireland during “The Troubles”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/delorean/img10.png&quot; alt=&quot;Delorean factory&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The DeLorean factory was a peaceful outpost in a sea of violence. Catholics and Protestants reported peacefully to work side by side, and the riots never found their way into the factory walls. It was considered by many to be something of a social experiment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to recap the situation, we now have an American car, designed by an Englishman, an Italian, and an American, which would be powered by a French/Swedish engine, going straight into mass production in war-torn Northern Ireland led by a workforce of 2,000 inexperienced employees. What could possibly go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything. Absolutely everything. There were countless setbacks, delays, and cost-overruns in the making of the car. When it was finally released for sale, it was a shadow of its original design in every way except visually. The DeLorean that reached the consumer was a poor-handling, slow ride riddled with quality control and design problems. Hitting the market years behind schedule in 1981, it was the disappointment of the decade. The panel gaps were ugly and inconsistent. The engine was a rear-mounted, 2.85 L (174 cu in) V6 made specifically for the DeLorean by Peugeot, Renault and Volvo Cars (PRV). It was rated at 130hp which is grossly underpowered for anything trying to call itself a sports car. The electrical system could barely keep up with its own demand leaving people stranded with dead batteries. The doors had countless issues, some reports even stating that drivers were getting trapped in their own vehicles. It did terribly in safety road tests, and on top of it all, its release was met by a recession which hurt the car market as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/delorean/img11.png&quot; alt=&quot;Delorean rear engine&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The DeLorean rear-mounted engine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As sales failed to come anywhere close to projections, John DeLorean decided to ramp up production, nearly doubling the production output of the car, and by February of 1982, DMC was $175 million in debt. The Dunberry factory was placed into receivership (forced bankrupcy) with 7000 unsold cars filling its warehouses. And then In October, John Z. DeLorean was arrested on charges of drug trafficking…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/delorean/img12.png&quot; alt=&quot;Delorean in warehouse&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Unsold DeLoreans stored in a warehouse, 1982&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can now briefly introduce a new scumbag character, one Jeff Hoffman. Hoffman was a major narcotics trafficker facing some serious charges who also happened to be an ex-neighbor of DeLorean. In an attempt to lessen charges against himself, he was working as an informant for the FBI. This was right around the time that Reagan announced the “War on Drugs” and, as such, catching big time drug dealers was all the rage. Hoffman approached the desperate DeLorean, arranging a deal where DeLorean would finance a major import of 220lb of cocaine, worth $24 million. In what would become the biggest trial of the year, DeLorean was set up with 59lb by the FBI and charged with 8 counts of drug-related charges. Being such a high profile person, the FBI and Hoffman were desperate to do everything in their power to take down DeLorean, and in said desperation, outright framed him for trafficking. In the end, DeLorean would be found not guilty on all charges, but the trial and negative publicity had already done its damage. The company was bankrupt, and with only 3 years of production, the DMC DeLorean was discontinued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Hidden camera footage of DeLorean’s arrest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DMC DeLorean’s astounding failure made it the laughing stock of the industry. It, along with its creator, had just barely enough time to slip out of memory before the release of Back to the Future in 1985, featuring a modified DeLorean as the iconic time machine. The wild success of the film instantly turned the car into a collectors item. Had DeLorean behaved even slightly more conservatively, and not been the dramatic risk-taker he had become so well known for, this movie would have easily saved him, his company, and his dream from complete demise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Side view of the infinitely badass DeLorean time machine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, DeLoreans are desirable collector cars with a strong fanbase who are quick to defend the car, its shortcomings, and its creator. With so many cars unsold, and warehouses filled with spare parts, servicing these cars was actually very doable, and still is today with 4 officially recognized dealerships across the country. There is, of course, also a strong market for customizing DeLoreans into Back to the Future replicas (complete with a flux capacitor and everything).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi there, my name is Phillip Van and I work for the Umass All-Campus Makerspace. 
Although I have no experience with coding or building circuits, I’ve always wanted to try to make my own Nanoleaf Aurora. 
As a result, this blog will document all of my essential research and findings for you to follow along with and hopefully this will help some of you guys create your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/nanoleaf/nano-wall.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background-what-is-the-nanoleaf-aurora&quot;&gt;Background: What is the Nanoleaf Aurora&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nanoleaf Aurora is essentially a system of triangular light fixtures with rainbow LEDs (RGB LEDs) inside of them. 
Each triangle is an individual leaf that can connect with other “leaves”. 
As a result, the Nanoleaf is an extremely modular and flexible light fixture that provides a lot of freedom for cool designs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/nanoleaf/musicnote.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s the catch&lt;/strong&gt;, for a set of just nine triangles, the total cost is &lt;strong&gt;$200&lt;/strong&gt;. 
On the other hand, a single 16.4 ft RGB LED strip costs less than $30 and would likely cover more room. 
I figured with the help of google, the Nanoleaf could easily be recreated for a fraction of the cost, below are my initial findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;research&quot;&gt;Research:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Googled: Nanoleaf DIY&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Findings:&lt;/strong&gt; A lot of people have done the same projects, creating their own Nanoleaf setup. It seems to be a fairly simple product, consisting of some triangle housings, some LEDS, and a small microcontroller (mini computer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a proof of concept that this project will be more economical than just buying the Nanoleaf here is a general bill of materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/nanoleaf/price.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a $50 price tag, our DIY Nanoleaf will cost approximately a quarter of the original price. In addition, many of these are one time purchases, creating more “leaves” will only make this project more economical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sneak-peak&quot;&gt;Sneak peak!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come back in the next blog post, where I play with RGB LEDs to learn how they work!

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever seen something or someone and thought, “Hey… I’d like to turn this into a 3D model that I can print”. Well think no more, I’m going to tell you how to get started, all you need is a smartphone and a computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got started using a drone, where images from above can provide quick and highly accurate models of large areas and buildings. But, the concepts are scalable, and a phone camera works just fine for small objects and people. 
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/photogram/agisoft-screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 1: Click on &amp;quot;Try it now&amp;quot; to start the free trial and download the product.&quot; /&gt;
Anyway, I used Agisoft Metashape to get started. It is a great product with a 30-day free trial and a very quick, easy download which is compatible
with Linux, Mac, and Windows. Give it a Google
search and find the free trial install.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;choose-your-subject&quot;&gt;Choose your Subject&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have Metashape installed, it is time to choose your object or person. I have found that people work best for 3D modeling using smartphones because of the texture, size, opacity, and reflectivity of human faces, but the right object can work just as well given the right circumstances. Professional photogrammeters use rigs in order to perfectly capture every angle of an object with a consistently lit surface.
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/photogram/camera-setup.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 2: This is a very professional setup as an example of stationary cameras and stationary subjects.&quot; /&gt;
For the purposes of this post, however, we leave the object or person stationary on the floor (or standing) and rotate the camera around it/them at many different (eyeballed) angles.
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/photogram/at-home.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 3: In this setup, a small object remains stationary while the camera rotates around it at set angles, with the same background.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-good-subject-means-that-it-is&quot;&gt;A good subject means that it is:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/photogram/face.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
-A person: people work really well in amateur photogrammetry processes because of likely bad lighting and the effectiveness of handheld smartphone cameras. This screenshot is my second attempt at a person. I only used about 65 images, and got subpar results, which is much better than it could have gone using so few images and terrible lighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/photogram/weird-fuckin-thing.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
-A larger object with low reflectivity and high opacity. Smaller objects don’t work as well with poor lighting and background because Metashape can’t tell what is the floor or what is the object – in other words, the depth is bad. Photogrammetric software has a lot of trouble understanding why reflective and see-through objects look so different from different angles. This table was the first object I attempted to model, it has a transparent glass top. It came out terrible – like a muffin too big for its container. This is because Metashape couldn’t understand what images belonged where in the model due to the see-through top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;take-the-photos&quot;&gt;Take the Photos&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you have your subject, find a wide open area with pretty consistent lightning. So, close windows, turn on overhead lights, and clear an area with about a 3foot radius around your subject, you will need more room than you think. If it’s cloudy outside, then that is perfect.
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/photogram/garage.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 4: Garages are great!&quot; /&gt;
Next take out your smartphone and photograph the subject! For the purpose of this, just have the subject stay stationary and rotate around with your camera. Auto settings are fine. The idea is to photograph 360 degrees around your subject at many different angles. So directly above (90 degrees), then slightly lower at about 65 degrees, then 35 degrees, then 0 degrees. This doesn’t have to be exact; the models will likely look like a first try. Try to get a decent amount of overlap as you rotate around the subject, but about 50 photos is plenty for your first model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;upload-and-process-in-metashape&quot;&gt;Upload and Process in Metashape&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hard part is over! Next, import your photos to Metashape as indicated in the figure below.
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/photogram/metashape.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
The rest of the process is very simple, but it does take time. Basically it will all be done in the workflow tab: 
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/photogram/selection.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Select them, and apply the processes in descending order. So, align the photos, then build dense cloud, then mesh, then texture. Each process will make the model look more and more like the real thing. Note: you must continuously crop during each step. You can do this very easily by using the crop tool: 
After you select points and areas which will be of the room you are modeling in, click the X two spaces the the right of the crop tool. This will delete the selected points. Alternatively, select the parts you want to keep and click the “crop selected” button three to the right of the crop tool in order to delete everything other than the selected. If you crop nothing, you will get something like this: 
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/photogram/photogram-finished.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
After each step, you can view progress by selecting “point cloud”, “dense cloud”, and “texture/mesh” views: 
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/photogram/textures.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another note: To hide the weird blue squares (which actually indicate where the picture was take and what angle relative to the subject), grid, and trackball, simply click Model 🡪 Show/hide items and then click whatever you don’t want to see anymore. 
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/photogram/fix.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
Default settings will be fine for this, with medium accuracy all around the board for quicker processing times. If you want a really crisp model, then increase the accuracy levels and it is very important to increase tie point limit and key tie point limit under advanced settings during the align photos phase (around 80,000+ and 10,000+ respectively).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you are still with me, you should be able to make a pretty good 3D model! If you try, and the photos don’t align (I usually look for about 80% of photos to align) or the model comes out terrible, it unfortunately is likely due to poor photos. There is no solution around that other than retake the photos in a different space with potentially a different object. But, that is the best way to learn what works and what doesn’t!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you so desire, these files can be exported and done with as you please. In the coming weeks, a new blog post and workshop will be posted on how to 3D print these files. So we can essentially 3D print a human. The week after that will be giving it artificial intelligence, then you can have your very own UMass makerspace clone!

Welcome to the Makerspace Automotive Newsletter! I’m Julius and I’m here to bring you an occasional blog post to teach you about automotive history, talk about current interesting innovations and happenings in the world of cars, and generally provide my commentary on all things automotive. Be it electric, gas, sedan, pickup, commuter or race, it’s like the wild freaking west out here and nothing is off limits….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, to kick things off I figured we could start with a little snippet of automotive history. A particular vehicle near and dear to my heart. The worst car ever made: &lt;strong&gt;The Trabant&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/trabant/image1.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Trabant&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Trabant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pictured above is a Trabant P50. I think it’s a 1959 model but honestly, don’t quote me on that because every year of this thing basically looks the same. At first glance you might be thinking: “Damn, Julius, that thing is kind of ugly, I guess, but mostly just a boring Euro-ish car. Why should I give a damn?” Well foolish reader, I’m here to tell you about how the Trabant was not only the WORST smelling car in automotive history, but how it’s a symbol of liberation, the fall of East Berlin, and the fight against communism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hold up. We need some background info first. Time for a quick German history lesson. In case you’re not totally familiar with your German history, here’s the gist of it. After WWII everyone hated everyone else, especially if they were a communist. Berlin was split down the middle where the West was governed by the Allies and the East was controlled by the Soviet Union. A wall was built 1961 that divided the two sides. That’s the Berlin Wall. Maybe you heard of it, maybe not, doesn’t matter.  The West refused to recognize the communist East and tensions were DUMMY high. Also, life big time sucked in East Berlin. Now you know all you need to know about East and West Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does this mean for our little Trabant friend? Well, the Trabant was manufactured in East Berlin. Actually, it was basically the ONLY car manufactured in East Berlin. As such, it provides a concise answer to the question that nobody was really asking: “What does a car look like when a nation has no means to build a car?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/trabant/image2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Newly born Trabant 601s. Released in 1967, these were essentially the final form of the Trabant as it remained virtually unchanged until production stopped. That said, these were barely even an upgrade from the original models.&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Newly born Trabant 601s. Released in 1967, these were essentially the final form of the Trabant as it remained virtually unchanged until production stopped. That said, these were barely even an upgrade from the original models.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s dive in. The Trabant was manufactured from 1957 to 1990 by VEB Sachsenring. During its production, 3.7 million of these things were built. It was a front-engine, front wheel drive 2-door sedan (with a 3-door station wagon option available in certain years). Due to a severe metal shortage, its body was constructed out of a hard type of plastic called Duroplast, which was made of resin, reinforced with recycled fabrics like wool and cotton. Yep, so back in the day you would quite literally be driving around in some stranger’s discarded underwear. Or that ugly knit sweater you got as a gift from your aunt and then “misplaced.” Now that sweater is someone’s grocery-getter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/trabant/image3.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Trabant was the first production car to ever be constructed out of recycled materials.&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/trabant/image4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/trabant/image5.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Trabant’s Engine weighed only 40kg. And if you take away all the body panels, this is all you get. This is everything that makes the Trabi go. Truly wack.&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Trabant’s Engine weighed only 40kg. And if you take away all the body panels, this is all you get. This is everything that makes the Trabi go. Truly wack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sweater was powered by a 500cc (.5L/31cu.in.) two cylinder, two stroke, air-cooled engine (later models were upgraded to a whopping 600cc). While sometimes used in certain older automotive applications, a two stroke engine is more commonly found in applications such as dirt bikes, power tools, lawnmowers, that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was truly the Little Engine That Couldn’t, but it had one very impressive aspect which was the fact that it was built with only 5 moving parts, drastically reducing wear and materials. 5 moving parts in an engine is NUTS. A typical V8 engine has something like 200+ moving parts not even considering the various accessories required to cool and power the thing. Everything about this car was so incredibly simple that any mom, dad, child, dog, cat, or vegetable could service this thing. All things said, the Trabant made 18 horsepower (25 by the end of its production). If you need me to put that into perspective, your mom’s new-ish toyota corolla makes about 130 horsepower and doesn’t suck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/trabant/image6.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every engine needs lubrication (change your oil, folks). Usually this is achieved by having a complete system which circulates oil throughout the engine, pumping it wherever it needs to be. The Trabant didn’t have any of that (Why add extra moving parts when you could just use one intake for both the oil AND the gas?). You refueled the trabant by mixing up gasoline and oil in the 6 gallon tank (~50:1 ratio) and shaking it up a bunch to mix it all up. The effect of this? This bastard smoked more than a cuban prime minister and THAT is the key component of why the Trabant smelled so bad: it was literally just burning oil by design. And if it’s not obvious, perpetually burning oil in such volume smells TERRIBLE. Not to mention you were basically taking a gatling gun to the ozone layer. This smoke machine produced nine times the hydrocarbons and five times the carbon-monoxide emissions than the average Euro car in 2007 (that’s… A LOT). Definitely not an emissions-compliant vehicle here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/trabant/image7.png&quot; alt=&quot;Although the factory guidelines stated a 50:1 Fuel to Oil ratio. Many Berliners were known to increase the quantity of oil, falsely believing it would increase engine reliability and longevity. More oil = more smoke = more stank.&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what was it really like to drive around in one of these things? What kind of creature comforts and convenience items could you expect (other than a built in James Bond-style smoke screen everywhere you went)? Cooled seats? Heated steering wheel? Adaptive climate control? No, of course not, dummy. The trabant was a (literal) pain in the ass to own, and in keeping with the general theme of East Berlin at the time, the driver’s seat of the Trabant was a deadly place to inhabit. Let’s just go over a FEW of the weird aspects of this car that any Trabi owner would have to cope with on a day to day basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that bit about refueling with a witch’s brew of oil and gas? Well this thing had no gas gauge, so to figure out how much gas was left, you would have to go outside, pop the hood, and check the level of the fuel tank with a little dipstick. And yes, you read that right. The fuel tank was located ABOVE the engine in a FRONT ENGINE vehicle. This effectively eliminated the need for a fuel pump as gravity would pull fuel out of the tank and straight into the engine. It also effectively eliminated the need for seat belts because a relatively minor collision could result in a fiery explosion that would probably just kill you anyways. Later models did get front seat belts, but rear passengers were always considered expendable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what features did this car have? Gas gauge? Nope. Seat belts? Lmao. Living to see your daughter’s wedding? Not in one of these you don’t. Reverse &amp;amp; hazard lights? An option if you had the extra cash! How about door locks? This is actually a feature the Trabant came equipped with. But it worked like this: the driver’s door could be locked/unlocked from the outside but not the inside, and the passenger’s door could be locked/unlocked from the inside but not the outside. Why, you ask? I don’t know, Communism or something?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything that could be manually operated on this car was… operated manually… Even down to the windshield washer fluid. Normally when you get dust and dirt on your windshield you push a button and a little electric motor sprays fluid over the glass. But that sounds like a lot of extra, useless nonsense compared to Trabant’s method: a plunger that you push and pull on the dashboard that manually pumps the fluid onto the windshield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/trabant/image8.png&quot; alt=&quot;Typical Trabant interior, except this one is lucky enough to have a radio.&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Typical Trabant interior, except this one is lucky enough to have a radio.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to imagine this. It’s 1981 and you’re a reluctant resident of East Berlin. You need to go get some groceries so you grab your keys and head outside to your lovely Trabant 601. You pop the hood and take out the little dipstick, dipping it into the engine and, alas, there is not enough fuel. You grab a pre-mixed container of gas and oil and give it a few shakes to make sure it’s all mixed up to top off your tank. Hopping onto the hard, non-conforming seats, you give the windshield a few pumps of cleaner which does absolutely nothing. You make peace with the lord as you start the car because prayer is your most promising safety feature. It stalls on the first few attempts, as you need to keep your foot on the gas for it to stay running (you can only cruise in 4th gear… sometimes…). Eventually you get to driving down the road, eyes burning from the exhaust smoke as you make your way downtown, imagery of being engulfed in the flames of your front-mounted gas tank filling your mind. You arrive, somehow unscathed, but you’ve forgotten your own name because of the carbon monoxide poisoning. Good times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, the Trabi truly was that awful. It was a terrible vehicle from every perspective except for cost management. Owning this car was a painful, shitty experience, but then again so was every aspect of life in East Berlin, and they didn’t exactly have many (any) options to choose from. Nonetheless, the Trabi would go on to solidify its place in history, becoming a badass little symbol of triumph against Communism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve covered all the aspects of the Trabant that make it awful, let’s talk about the things that make it, well, kind of badass actually. The public image of the Trabant is mixed. For many former East Berliners, it painfully (and accurately) represented the absurd conditions that had to be endured under Communist rule: slow, unreliable, and dangerous. Many Trabants were left to rot in abandonment out of pain and spite. However, to others, the Trabant stands as a symbol of triumph, after surviving the difficult times of the era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those days, the Trabant was sometimes modified to be used as an agent to smuggle people from East Berlin into the West across the wall. When rare occasions presented that folks were allowed to cross, citizens were sometimes smuggled in the trunks, and sometimes even in the engine compartments of the Trabant, some being modified to allow more occupancy and discretion. The clown-car shenanigans that were pulled in these vehicles put any circus to shame, and these were performed in the name of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As times progressed on the Western side of the Iron Curtain, the automotive industry leapt into the 70s and 80s, with computer-controlled engines, electronic fuel injection, and emissions control, but the trabant remained virtually unchanged. A stark representation of the decline of Soviet power. By the late 80s, border control between East and West weakened and the lines of Trabants snaked their way out of East Berlin in what is now known as the “Trabi Trail,” seeking out new lives beyond the wall. In 1989 the Berlin Wall officially fell, and citizens flooded the streets in their Trabants, followed by the blue exhaust fumes, dubbed “the perfume of freedom.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/trabant/image9.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Trabi Trail&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Trabi Trail&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, the Trabant has become something of a collectors item, and a tourist attraction. Many seek out these cars, some being modified in fun creative ways and others being restored and kept as tokens of German history. You can see these cars all over Germany still, being led in tourist convoys (pay some ridiculous amount of money and drive a trabant) or in car meets. You can always tell when one is nearby the horrible buzzing sound it makes and the smell from a mile away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the wall came down, the Trabi became a popular subject in media and culture, and the subject of numerous movies (typically as a method of indirectly making fun of the Soviet government). Ever see that freaky show, Herbie? The one about the sentient VW Beetle that… races? Or something? Well anyways, there’s a Trabi knockoff of that show. There even grew to be some superstitions surrounding the car, with some believing that Green Trabants bring good luck (which hilariously drives up their market price).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trabi is a freaky little deathtrap. It’s fun and easy to laugh at it and make into an easy target for an automotive writing piece. Nonetheless, you can’t kick these tires without acknowledging the legitimate historical significance of this car. The Trabant’s existence is a reminder of not only the liberation of the Eastern Bloc, but of all the turmoil that led up to it under Soviet powers.

The Trabant was the first production car to ever be constructed out of recycled materials. The Trabant’s Engine weighed only 40kg. And if you take away all the body panels, this is all you get. This is everything that makes the Trabi go. Truly wack. That sweater was powered by a 500cc (.5L/31cu.in.) two cylinder, two stroke, air-cooled engine (later models were upgraded to a whopping 600cc). While sometimes used in certain older automotive applications, a two stroke engine is more commonly found in applications such as dirt bikes, power tools, lawnmowers, that kind of thing. This was truly the Little Engine That Couldn’t, but it had one very impressive aspect which was the fact that it was built with only 5 moving parts, drastically reducing wear and materials. 5 moving parts in an engine is NUTS. A typical V8 engine has something like 200+ moving parts not even considering the various accessories required to cool and power the thing. Everything about this car was so incredibly simple that any mom, dad, child, dog, cat, or vegetable could service this thing. All things said, the Trabant made 18 horsepower (25 by the end of its production). If you need me to put that into perspective, your mom’s new-ish toyota corolla makes about 130 horsepower and doesn’t suck. Every engine needs lubrication (change your oil, folks). Usually this is achieved by having a complete system which circulates oil throughout the engine, pumping it wherever it needs to be. The Trabant didn’t have any of that (Why add extra moving parts when you could just use one intake for both the oil AND the gas?). You refueled the trabant by mixing up gasoline and oil in the 6 gallon tank (~50:1 ratio) and shaking it up a bunch to mix it all up. The effect of this? This bastard smoked more than a cuban prime minister and THAT is the key component of why the Trabant smelled so bad: it was literally just burning oil by design. And if it’s not obvious, perpetually burning oil in such volume smells TERRIBLE. Not to mention you were basically taking a gatling gun to the ozone layer. This smoke machine produced nine times the hydrocarbons and five times the carbon-monoxide emissions than the average Euro car in 2007 (that’s… A LOT). Definitely not an emissions-compliant vehicle here. Although the factory guidelines stated a 50:1 Fuel to Oil ratio. Many Berliners were known to increase the quantity of oil, falsely believing it would increase engine reliability and longevity. More oil = more smoke = more stank. So what was it really like to drive around in one of these things? What kind of creature comforts and convenience items could you expect (other than a built in James Bond-style smoke screen everywhere you went)? Cooled seats? Heated steering wheel? Adaptive climate control? No, of course not, dummy. The trabant was a (literal) pain in the ass to own, and in keeping with the general theme of East Berlin at the time, the driver’s seat of the Trabant was a deadly place to inhabit. Let’s just go over a FEW of the weird aspects of this car that any Trabi owner would have to cope with on a day to day basis. Remember that bit about refueling with a witch’s brew of oil and gas? Well this thing had no gas gauge, so to figure out how much gas was left, you would have to go outside, pop the hood, and check the level of the fuel tank with a little dipstick. And yes, you read that right. The fuel tank was located ABOVE the engine in a FRONT ENGINE vehicle. This effectively eliminated the need for a fuel pump as gravity would pull fuel out of the tank and straight into the engine. It also effectively eliminated the need for seat belts because a relatively minor collision could result in a fiery explosion that would probably just kill you anyways. Later models did get front seat belts, but rear passengers were always considered expendable. So what features did this car have? Gas gauge? Nope. Seat belts? Lmao. Living to see your daughter’s wedding? Not in one of these you don’t. Reverse &amp;amp; hazard lights? An option if you had the extra cash! How about door locks? This is actually a feature the Trabant came equipped with. But it worked like this: the driver’s door could be locked/unlocked from the outside but not the inside, and the passenger’s door could be locked/unlocked from the inside but not the outside. Why, you ask? I don’t know, Communism or something? Everything that could be manually operated on this car was… operated manually… Even down to the windshield washer fluid. Normally when you get dust and dirt on your windshield you push a button and a little electric motor sprays fluid over the glass. But that sounds like a lot of extra, useless nonsense compared to Trabant’s method: a plunger that you push and pull on the dashboard that manually pumps the fluid onto the windshield. Typical Trabant interior, except this one is lucky enough to have a radio. Take a moment to imagine this. It’s 1981 and you’re a reluctant resident of East Berlin. You need to go get some groceries so you grab your keys and head outside to your lovely Trabant 601. You pop the hood and take out the little dipstick, dipping it into the engine and, alas, there is not enough fuel. You grab a pre-mixed container of gas and oil and give it a few shakes to make sure it’s all mixed up to top off your tank. Hopping onto the hard, non-conforming seats, you give the windshield a few pumps of cleaner which does absolutely nothing. You make peace with the lord as you start the car because prayer is your most promising safety feature. It stalls on the first few attempts, as you need to keep your foot on the gas for it to stay running (you can only cruise in 4th gear… sometimes…). Eventually you get to driving down the road, eyes burning from the exhaust smoke as you make your way downtown, imagery of being engulfed in the flames of your front-mounted gas tank filling your mind. You arrive, somehow unscathed, but you’ve forgotten your own name because of the carbon monoxide poisoning. Good times. Yes, the Trabi truly was that awful. It was a terrible vehicle from every perspective except for cost management. Owning this car was a painful, shitty experience, but then again so was every aspect of life in East Berlin, and they didn’t exactly have many (any) options to choose from. Nonetheless, the Trabi would go on to solidify its place in history, becoming a badass little symbol of triumph against Communism. Now that we’ve covered all the aspects of the Trabant that make it awful, let’s talk about the things that make it, well, kind of badass actually. The public image of the Trabant is mixed. For many former East Berliners, it painfully (and accurately) represented the absurd conditions that had to be endured under Communist rule: slow, unreliable, and dangerous. Many Trabants were left to rot in abandonment out of pain and spite. However, to others, the Trabant stands as a symbol of triumph, after surviving the difficult times of the era. In those days, the Trabant was sometimes modified to be used as an agent to smuggle people from East Berlin into the West across the wall. When rare occasions presented that folks were allowed to cross, citizens were sometimes smuggled in the trunks, and sometimes even in the engine compartments of the Trabant, some being modified to allow more occupancy and discretion. The clown-car shenanigans that were pulled in these vehicles put any circus to shame, and these were performed in the name of freedom. As times progressed on the Western side of the Iron Curtain, the automotive industry leapt into the 70s and 80s, with computer-controlled engines, electronic fuel injection, and emissions control, but the trabant remained virtually unchanged. A stark representation of the decline of Soviet power. By the late 80s, border control between East and West weakened and the lines of Trabants snaked their way out of East Berlin in what is now known as the “Trabi Trail,” seeking out new lives beyond the wall. In 1989 the Berlin Wall officially fell, and citizens flooded the streets in their Trabants, followed by the blue exhaust fumes, dubbed “the perfume of freedom.” The Trabi Trail Nowadays, the Trabant has become something of a collectors item, and a tourist attraction. Many seek out these cars, some being modified in fun creative ways and others being restored and kept as tokens of German history. You can see these cars all over Germany still, being led in tourist convoys (pay some ridiculous amount of money and drive a trabant) or in car meets. You can always tell when one is nearby the horrible buzzing sound it makes and the smell from a mile away. After the wall came down, the Trabi became a popular subject in media and culture, and the subject of numerous movies (typically as a method of indirectly making fun of the Soviet government). Ever see that freaky show, Herbie? The one about the sentient VW Beetle that… races? Or something? Well anyways, there’s a Trabi knockoff of that show. There even grew to be some superstitions surrounding the car, with some believing that Green Trabants bring good luck (which hilariously drives up their market price). The Trabi is a freaky little deathtrap. It’s fun and easy to laugh at it and make into an easy target for an automotive writing piece. Nonetheless, you can’t kick these tires without acknowledging the legitimate historical significance of this car. The Trabant’s existence is a reminder of not only the liberation of the Eastern Bloc, but of all the turmoil that led up to it under Soviet powers.

&lt;p&gt;One of the most used tools in any shop will likely be a cordless drill. At the UMass Amherst Makerspace, we use Milwaukee M18 Fuel ½” hammer drill/drivers. In many words, it’s this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/drills/image1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our drill of choice&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drills are easy and generally very safe tools, and can make holes in material (wood, metal, masonry), and they can attach two materials together using screws. This all sounds dumb right? Everybody knows what a drill is and how to use it - you just pull the trigger and walk away. This is true! But, not everybody knows how to use drills the &lt;em&gt;right way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-started&quot;&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to do is grab a battery and a drill from our charging station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/drills/image2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Drill battery and charger&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Drill battery (left) and charger (right)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slide the battery into the slot on the drill. Next, you need a bit. Depending on what size hole you will be drilling, or what type of screw you are driving you will need a bit with the corresponding size and shape. To choose a bit for driving screws, find the screw you want and try pushing your bit into the top of it. If it fits snugly, you’ve got the right bit! To decide on a bit to drive a hole, you want to find one that is just slightly bigger than the screw you’ll be using. To install the bit, twist the black piece on the drill that is located right past the torque dial (grey rotating piece). Twisting this loosens and tightens the drill’s grip on bits, or the chuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/drills/image3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Figure 1: Philips head drill bit, used for driving screws&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;adjusting-speed-and-torque&quot;&gt;Adjusting Speed and Torque&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To adjust the speed, flip the black switch located on top. There will be a 1 (slow) and a 2 (fast) setting. Typically, if you are driving screws you will want higher speeds, and drilling holes you will want lower speeds. This then brings torque into play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To adjust torque, simply twist the grey dial with numbers 1-14 and a couple symbols on it. To drill a hole, switch the speed to 1, and adjust the torque to the drill setting (it looks like a drill bit, and is the highest torque possible). Drilling holes is best done with &lt;strong&gt;low speed and high torque.&lt;/strong&gt; Driving screws is a bit different: start with high speed and the lowest torque possible. Each time the drill won’t drive the screw any deeper, move up in torque. Continue this process until the screw is flush with the material you are screwing into. Whatever number you landed on is what you should continue the project on (this is the torque required for whatever material you are using). Adjust as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/drills/image6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Drill overhead&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UMass Amherst Makerspace is an interdisciplinary makerspace open to students, staff, and faculty from all majors and disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We provide access to space, tools, equipment, training, and help connect individuals and facilitate mentorship and sharing of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major focus of the makerspace is re-use, repair, and re-purposing. We want to reduce waste and costs by serving as a hub for the community to share used tools, equipment, materials, furniture, and more. Much of what we have has been donated or saved from the campus waste stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UMass Amherst Maker Network is an ongoing project to connect students, faculty, and staff with resources for making all over campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To connect the UMass Amherst maker community with information and access pathways to existing resources on campus, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;facilities and equipment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people and expertise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;workshops, and events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a central All-Campus Makerspace, which will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;serve as a starting point for most makers on campus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provide access to training and equipment for many common maker technologies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;serve as the campus maker community focal point and host events related to making&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our temporary location for Spring 2020 is the Astronomy Building, located near ELab and the Gunness Laboratory at the location indicated on the map above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to visit the makerspace in this location and are looking to plan your visit with accessibility in mind, send an email to &lt;a href=&quot;umamakerspace@umass.edu&quot;&gt;umamakerspace@umass.edu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Navya Ravavarapu</name></author><category term="About Us" /><summary type="html">Welcome to the staff of the UMass Amherst Makerspace The UMass Amherst Makerspace is an interdisciplinary makerspace open to students, staff, and faculty from all majors and disciplines.
