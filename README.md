## UMass Amherst Makerspace Blog

This is the UMass Amherst Makerspace blog (formerly UMass Amherst All-Campus Makerspace) and is built on top of jekyll, github pages, and uses travis-ci.

This repository is currently maintained by @jack-champagne, @LaurelParsons, and @navyaravavarapu.

This blog was started as the makerspace moved online during the COVID-19 pandemic.
